# LU Factorization w/ partial Pivoting
A MATLAB function which determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix using partial pivoting.

The inputs required for the function are:
1) a coefficient matrix
2) an output matrix

The outputs of the function are:
1) a lower triangular matrix with 1's along the diagonals
2) an upper triangular matrix
3) a pivot matrix
